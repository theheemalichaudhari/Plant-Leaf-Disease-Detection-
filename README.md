# Plant-Leaf-Disease-Detection-
The economy makes the most difference in how productive agriculture is. Because of the aforementioned factor, plant diseases are more prevalent in the agricultural sector and are easier to diagnose. Detecting plant diseases in broad and diverse fields crops is becoming more and more scrutinized these days. Farmers experience major difficulties when switching from one disease management strategy to another when cutting their crops. The typical method for detection is to be able to recognise or spot leaf diseases for surveillance and monitoring professionals. If the appropriate control measures aren't performed, the plants suffer severely, which affects both the productivity and quality of the plants. The adoption of a technological approach or technique for disease detection is effective and beneficial since it lessens the burdensome work of surveillance in the vast cultivation. We can identify plant disease symptoms in the early stages even before they manifest on a plant's leaves. We can determine the technique for picture segmentation and automatic classification utilized for the detection of illnesses of leaves in plants by utilizing an artificial neural network. Additionally, it discusses various disease classification techniques used to find plant diseases.
